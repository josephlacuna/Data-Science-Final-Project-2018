# data_science_final_project_2018
We looked at a data set about movies from kaggle and wanted to perform some exploratory analysis.  Loading in the data it was clear that this was a big set with some unfamiliar terrain.  Our first goal was to perform a sentiment analysis, which we did with the positive and negative words, on the overview of movies in the data set.  The overview was a brief couple sentence synopsis accompanying each film title.  The positive/negative analysis was likely not the appropriate choice, but it is a robust and full list, and we thought it was a good choice then.  The overviews were split into positive, negative, and neutral, and then plotted against the log of revenue, average rating of the film from IMdb, and budget.  There appeared to be little correlation with any of the plots.
